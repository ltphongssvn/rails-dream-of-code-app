# Lesson 4 Assignment: Create Your Own Data Model and Schema

## Assignment Status: COMPLETED âœ…

This week's assignment focused on creating a custom data model and schema design. The assignment content has been integrated into `lesson-02-assignment` as Questions 3 and 4.

## Assignment Content Location

The Week 4 assignment is documented in `lesson-02-assignment`:
- **Question 3**: Project Description - Hourly Time Tracker & Productivity System
- **Question 4**: Data Model Design for the time tracking application

## Project Summary: Hourly Time Tracker & Productivity System

### Project Overview
A web-based time tracking application that allows users to log activities for each hour of their day and compare time usage patterns across different periods.

### Target Users
- Students tracking study hours and learning habits
- Professionals balancing work, exercise, and personal time
- Anyone optimizing their daily routines

### Core Features
1. **Activity Logging**: Hour-by-hour activity tracking with categories
2. **Historical Comparison**: Compare current patterns with past periods
3. **Goal Setting**: Set targets based on historical data
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor goal achievement and trends

### Data Model Design

#### Main Tables:
- **users**: User accounts with timezone support
- **categories**: Activity types (work, sleep, exercise, learning, etc.)
- **time_entries**: Core data linking users to categories by date/hour
- **goals**: User-defined targets for time usage
- **goal_completions**: Progress tracking for goal achievement

#### Key Design Decisions:
- Hour stored as integer (0-23) for efficient queries
- Duration in minutes for partial hour tracking
- Parent categories for hierarchical organization
- User timezone storage for accurate time tracking
- Composite indexes for performance optimization

## Implementation Notes

The data model supports:
- Multi-user time tracking with privacy
- Flexible categorization system
- Historical pattern analysis
- Goal setting and progress monitoring
- Timezone-aware time management

This assignment demonstrates proficiency in:
- Database schema design
- Entity relationship modeling
- Performance optimization through indexing
- User experience consideration in data structure
- Scalable application architecture
